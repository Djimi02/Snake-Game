# Snake-Game
The Snake is a classic arcade-style video game. The player controls a snake, using the arrows of the keyboard as controls. Every time a snake eats an apple, the snake gets longer. If the snake bumps into its body or any of the grid boundaries, the game finishes. The player can chose between solid grid boundaries or disable them and use them as portals that teleport the snake to the other side of the grid.
